In this project I created a simulation with a simple 4 wheel real robot. 
The controller for this robot is written in C and focuses on avoiding collisions.

I used the "Webots" framework which is a robot simulator that provides a complete development environment to model, program and simulate robots.
The framework allows you to program in python, C, C++, Java,MATLAB and ROS.

The robot is a simple 4 wheels robot with 2 distance sensors on the front:

The controller is based on "Braitenberg vehicle":

The Braitenberg vehicle is a concept conceived in a thought experiment by the Italian-Austrian cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg.
"we look at these machines or vehicles as if they were animals in a natural environment " (Braitenberg, 1984)

In this case, the motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by 2 distance sensors, yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent.

The outputs of the simulation:
